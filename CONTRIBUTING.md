Due to the highly probable changes in the way we're going to provide Sotoon's
AI services, and that the team that's responsible for this repo is highly
overloaded, we **DON'T accept contributions** on this project for now. But we
are actively checking the issues, so if you need a feature, or want to report
a bug, or you even have a question, just open an issue.
